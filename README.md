 About Project
 ----------------

# Unobtrusive Validations is a js library and make use of jQuery Validation's native support for validation driven by HTML 5 data attributes. 
# APS.NET MVC makes use of these validations where you need to define validation attributes on your model classes.
# Many of us might have assumption that this works only for ASP.NET MVC, But it's not true. To prove that i created a this demo project, where i took a native html and used many attributes of Unobtrusive JS library.
# Yo can add a custom validations of your need by few lines of code.
